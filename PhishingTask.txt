1.Obtain a sample phishing email

-> Suspicious_email.png

2.Examine sender's email address for spoofing
•  Sender: BinanceMail <BinanceMail2@onmailcloud.onmicrosoft.com>
•  The email domain onmailcloud.onmicrosoft.com is not an official Binance domain (which would usually be @binance.com or a verified Binance domain).
•  This suggests the sender address is spoofed or fake.



3. Check email headers for discrepancies
=>Here’s the image—check it out.

4.Identify suspicious links or attachments
=>Suspicious Links
•	The email says:
"Fοllοw the instructiοns οn οur website to check your eligibility.
Jοin Airdrοp"
•	There’s an implied call to action “Join Airdrop” which should be a clickable link or button.
•	However, the actual URL is not shown in the text you provided, so we can’t see the link’s destination.

Attachments
•	No attachments are mentioned or shown in the email text.



4. Look for urgent or threatening language in the email body
Urgent language found:
•	“We are starting a limited-time ARB airdrop…” creates scarcity.
•	“The first 2500 to apply can receive up to 80,000 ARB (~ USD 80,000)” pushes quick action.
•	“The airdrop will end on July 29, 2023, 18:00 UTC” sets a deadline.
•	“Limited supply of 50,00,000 ARB tokens… first come, first served basis” reinforces urgency.
Threatening language:
•	None found. No threats or warnings are used.

5. Verify presence of spelling or grammar errors
•	The email uses Greek letters instead of normal English ones (e.g., “Β” for “B”, “ο” for “o”), making it look strange.
•	Some text is written backwards, like “completely free!” reversed, which is very unusual.
•	Numbers are incorrectly formatted, e.g., “50,00,000” instead of “5,000,000” or “50,000,000.”
•	Overall, these errors strongly suggest this is a phishing or scam email, not a real Binance message.





6. Summarize phishing traits found in the email
•	Sender’s email looks fake, not official Binance.
•	Uses weird Greek letters making text hard to read.
•	Tries to rush you with limited time and tokens.
•	Pushes you to click a link without showing real URL.
•	Some text is backwards, very suspicious.
•	Lots of spelling mistakes and bad grammar.
•	No attachments, but wants you to click on unsafe links.
